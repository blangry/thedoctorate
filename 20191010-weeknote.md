# Research note 10th October

## Reading
A while ago, [Richard Pope](https://twitter.com/richardjpope) introduced me to Andrew Schrock also at the Harvard Kennedy School, and it has been great to see other anthropology/science technology studies people and what they're reading.

Worth reading the thread, but it's been sufficiently interesting for me to order a used copy for ~Â£2 and I'm hoping for good things.

I have a huge backlog of books that need reading, but Health Stuff has been leaving me laid out and my eyes won't co-operate. If only audible covered my DPhil reading backlog.

I've also been reading a copy of the LRB that I bought for a long train journey. The takedown of John Updike that's been all over twitter has been delighful.

## "Work" work
We've got a supplier lined up to start. We've got a department to work with. It's fun and still mindbendingly complicated (good thing)
I've been trying to write a little newsletter for the team to send out the links I've seen each week, and I think you deserve them too.
- *AI and the Law*. When can you use AI to select documents on a server to be part of evidence in a case? There's case law on that.

Go from Sections 5 to 24 (more or less).

- Thinking about the culture of people building Artificial Intelligence.
This came up in my PhD reading this week, and I thought it would be worth sharing.

## Health
I've just been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis after five weeks of pain and blood. Glad to have a diagnosis and a treatment plan. Sad to have another disease that's going to mess with my life. It is early days, so I don't know what this is going to be like to live with. It's painful so far and I'm pretty exhausted and feel a bit through the wringer with it all. I'm grateful to the offers of company but it will need to wait until my energy is higher.

## Film photography
Got some films back. I've been using Aperture photography off TCR to develop since Lomo in Soho closed down. They're _really_ good. A bit pricey, but good folks and do an amazing job with the prints and good detail on the scans.

## Career
I'm feeling a bit out of strategy. I want lots of things that seem mutually exclusive. I want to get a more senior role in the next year or two. I want to work with less than daily travel. I'd like to do four days a week so I can be a parent. I'm looking for people's ideas on what I should or could do to get there.

# Music
Been listening/hallucinating to a few songs on repeat. They don't fit together, but I've put them in a playlist anyway.
